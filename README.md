## Features

**Database Integration with Social Media like UI:** This project has integrated a highly scalable mySQL database. Functionalities include creating, modifying, and deleting rows, as well as executing queries. Taking inspiration from popular social media platforms, `cur-database-react` presents a visually engaging and intuitive user interface. Users will find it familiar and easy to navigate, enhancing their overall experience.

**Built with React.js and Typescript:** It leverages the power of React.js, a popular JavaScript library, to create a responsive and efficient user interface,
in combination with TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript adds type safety and enhances the development experience. React.js ensures a smooth user experience, allowing for quick and seamless data manipulation.
